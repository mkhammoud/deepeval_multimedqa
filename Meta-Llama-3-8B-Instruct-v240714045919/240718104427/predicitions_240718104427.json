        "Prediction":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Grave's disease is a type of hyperthyroidism and is caused by an overactive thyroid gland. This is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive and produces excessive amounts of thyroxine. This can cause swelling of the thyroid gland and the eyes, and it can also cause a goiter. The thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped gland located at the base of the neck and is responsible for producing thyroid hormones. In Grave's disease, the thyroid gland is overactive and produces excessive amounts of thyroxine. This can cause a goiter, which is swelling of the thyroid gland. In some cases, the eyes can also be affected and this is known as ophthalmoplegia. In the past, Grave's disease was also known to cause a condition called Derbyshire neck, which is a swelling of the neck. This is a condition where the neck is swollen and looks like a derby. This is a condition which is not seen in current times. Please do not worry.",
